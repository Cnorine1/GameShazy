Battle after battle has shown the naval forces of
Planet Orange the folly of their surprise attack.
With your fighter now free of the enemy fleets
carrying news of the surprise attack, you are
able to link up with allied forces. Suddenly,
you find yourself leading the charge against
Planet Orange, but now with an armada at your
back.



Good luck.
